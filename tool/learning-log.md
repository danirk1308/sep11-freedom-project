Tool: Kaboom.js

Project: Creating a side scroll game (Mario or Sonic style). The main character has to try and pass all the levels while collecting coins and if he won't be able to collect all the coins than he won't be able to go through the next level. While the character is getting the coins there is going to be bad guys that will be on each level trying to stop the character from getting the coins.
