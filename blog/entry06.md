This year has been a really great journey because of how much I improved in my software engineering class. I was able to create a functional platforming game just by learning a lot about Kaboom.js and adding it into my IDE turning it into my freedom project which I certaintly am proud of, I'm proud of myself for learning a lot about a website that teaches you how to create your own game and making my own game from Kaboom.js, I have completed my project, Finished my slides to present in front of the class and Later on present my project to the  judges at my school's SEP Expo. When I first presented my project I was completely nervous because I didn't know what to say at the beginning but later on I learned that the more you practice the better you get.
